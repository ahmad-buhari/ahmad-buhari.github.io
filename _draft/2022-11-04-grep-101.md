## Introduction
---
Linux operating system provides robust capabilities. Often it is deployed without a graphical interface (GUI). So trying to search for a specific text using the command line can be daunting, especially if you're searching through hundreds of files. Case in point, looking for an event from the log files.

In this tutorial, we'll cover the grep command to help simplify the process.

## Shell Terminal Example
---
Here's a quick demo of how the commands work running on a [replit](https://replit.com/) instance.

### Ignore case sensitivity
In demo 1 it runs the  `grep -i` to ignore case sensitivity.
```bash
cat word-list | grep -i h
```

### Skip Characters
In demo 2 it runs grep -v to skip a character and -i again to ignore case sensitivity.
```bash
cat word-list | grep -vi h 
```

### Search starting character
In demo 3 it runs `grep \<` to search for the beginning character.
```bash
cat word-list | grep \<t
```

### Search the ending character
In demo 4 it runs `grep \>` to search for the ending character
```bash
cat word-list | grep t\>
```


### Search special character
In demo 5 it runs `grep '[[:punct:]]'` to search special characters
```bash
cat word-list | grep '[[:punct:]]'
```

### Search for a fix digit interval
In demo 6 it runs `grep -P '(?<!\d)\d{4}(?!\d)'` using -P to leverage a perl expression.
- Here's a good article on [StackExchange by Eliah Kagan](https://askubuntu.com/questions/538730/how-to-grep-for-groups-of-n-digits-but-no-more-than-n) explaining in detail.

```bash
cat word-list | grep -P '(?<!\d)\d{4}(?!\d)'
```
