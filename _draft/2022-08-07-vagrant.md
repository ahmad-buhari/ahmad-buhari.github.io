# Automation with VirtualBox, Vagrant & Chef
Scaling up to robust lab enviroment for automation using:
- Chef
- Vagrant
- VirtualBox

## Prepping the compute element

### 1. If using windows disable Hyper-V
Disable Hyper-V & reboot using PowerShell 
```
    Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-All
```

### 2. Download VirtualBox Application
Follow default prompts, download from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads is a software defined hypervisor for creating virtual machines. The Chef and Vagrant application works well with VirtualBox. 

### 3. Download Vagrant Application
Follow default prompts, download from https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads the application allows you to deploy VMs using CLI in a consistent manner.
- by default vagrant box images are stored in the `./vagrant` directory

### 4. Download Chef Workstation
Follow defaults prompts, download from https://www.chef.io/downloads/tools/workstation the application is open-source that provides template deployment for OS

## Testing Environment

### Test vagrant application functionality
On a linux instance run `sudo /sbin/vboxconfig` ensure all checks are cleared.
1. Testing Vagrant Application
    - Run vagrant commands to ensure application installed correctly.
    <p>

2. Start/Initialize the Project
Navigate to the project folder and initialize a vagrant config file `vagrant.exe init hashicorp/bionic64` note bionic64 is a maintained custom image of Ubuntu by hashicorp.

3. Start the vagrant VM installation
Run `vagrant.exe up` this will initiate the build process, it will look for the vagrant version of ubuntu if not available it will download from the Vagrant Cloud https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/bionic64

4. Destory the vagrant instance
Run `vagrant.exe destroy` this will destroy the vagrant vm instance.


### Test Chef Application

1. Create a Chef Project Subfolder 
I recommend creating the subfolder within the same project directory for easy management/reference example `chef_myproj`. It can get confusing as the build progress with new files and folders. Hence take the time to plan out the folder structure for the project. 

2. Initialize a Chef cookbook (a.k.a template)
Naviagate to the project folder and use `chef generate cookbook chef_myproj` note chef_myproj is the subfolder where all the configuration files for Chef will be saved in.

3. Test build with kitchen
Run `kitchen list` to test deployable vagrant vm instances
<p>

### Note: Code deployment for Ubuntu64, requires internet to download the packages & depenedcies
