## Introduction

Scheduling task can be done with the `at` or `cron` command, each has it's own usuage.
- The `at` command for single schedule tasks.
- The `cron` command for batch schedule tasks.

### Scheduling task with `at`
In this example we we'll schedule a job in 10 minuntes.
```bash
echo "date >> ~/log-date.txt" | at now +10min
```

### Check scheduled job
Run `atq` to chcek the job queue.
```bash
atq
```

### Remove job 
```bash
Run `atrm` to remove a job by it's id.
```

### Scheduling task with `cron`
Scheduling a cron job use is different since it's configured for recurring jobs. 
1. First run `crontab -e` to write the job interactively.
2. There are 5 fields to be fill, and the * respresents the lowest value.
    | ID | Fields | Accepted values |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 1 | Minutes | 0-59 |
    | 2 | Hours | 0-23 |
    | 3 | Days in month | 0-31 | 
    | 4 | Months | 0-12 or Jan to Dec|
    | 5 | Days in week | 0-7 or Mon - Sun |
