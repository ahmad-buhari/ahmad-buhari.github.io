## Why Build?
---
For any inspiring professional wanting to break into the tech field, you have to learn and perform your craft quickly. 

I've learned over time the fastest way to upskill for a technical IT craft is going straight to the hands-on portion combined with visual aids like reading and watching videos. Doing these projects and documenting the process in GitHub or other websites helps showcase your skills.

### Environments
- Compute Node
- Software based Hypervisor (a.k.a Virtualization software)
- Operating Systems in ISO format

### 1. Install Virtualization Software
I recommend using VMware Player as the virtualization software. It has a simple user interface, and the free version provides all the required tools to get started. Download VMware Player directly from [VMware's Website](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html)

### 2. Download the Operating System
There are multiple ways to download an operating systems. For Microsoft, navigate to their [evaluation website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/). For Linux systems, navigate to [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/download/) (RedHat distribution) or [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download) (Debian distribution) website.

### 3. Deploy the Virtual Machine
Once the operating system is downloaded, deploy the virtual machine using the recommended system requirements.

### Example of a running Cyber Range Lab
Below is the topology of my current lab, I always recommend writing down your network diagram. It's helps you troubleshoot issues and is a real-world skill for IT jobs. A quick plug to [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/) for offering a solid open source diagram web tool.
