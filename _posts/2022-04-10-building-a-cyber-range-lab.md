## Why Build?
---
For any inspiring professional wanting to break into the tech field, you have to learn and perform your craft quickly. 

I've experinced over time the fastest way to learn is to get straight into the hands-on portion and combine the learning experience with visual aids like reading documentation and watching videos.

### Environments
- Compute Node
- Software based Hypervisor (a.k.a Virtualization software)
- Operating Systems in ISO format

### 1. Install Virtualization Software
I recommend using VMware Player as the virtualization software. It has a simple user interface, and the free version provides all the required tools to get started. Download VMware Player directly from [VMware's Website](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html)

### 2. Download the Operating System
There are multiple ways to download an operating systems. For Microsoft, navigate to their [evaluation website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/). For Linux systems, navigate to [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/download/) (RedHat distribution) or [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download) (Debian distribution) website.

### 3. Deploy the Virtual Machine
Once the operating system is downloaded, deploy the virtual machine using the recommended system requirements.
