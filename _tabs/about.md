Hi, welcome to my page where I document things I've learned in technology. I've been in the IT field since 2014 and I'm currently working as an IT Manager for a Blue Team in the UK.


Our responsibilities include validating system compliances using the Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs), patch CVE findings, conducting log analysis, and a bunch more cyber security stuff.


## Things I'm doing
---
- Updating my website to use the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) framework.
- Writing a quick cleanup script for log data.
- Studying for the [Red Hat Certified System Administrator](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcsa).
