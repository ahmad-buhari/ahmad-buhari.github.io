Often it is deployed without a graphical interface (GUI). So trying to search for a specific text using the command line can be daunting, especially if you’re searching through hundreds of files. Case in point, looking for an event from the log files.In this tutorial, we’ll cover the grep command to help simplify the process.Shell Terminal ExampleHere’s a quick demo how the commands work running on a replit instance.Ignore case sensitivityIn demo 1 it runs the grep -i to ignore case sensitivity.grep -i h word-listSkip CharactersIn demo 2 it runs grep -v to skip a character and -i again to ignore case sensitivity.grep -vi h word-listSearch starting characterIn demo 3 it runs grep \\&lt; to search the begining character.grep \\&lt;t word-listSearch ending characterIn demo 4 it runs grep \\&gt; to search for the ending charactergrep t\\&gt; word-listSearch special characterIn demo 5 it runs grep '[[:punct:]]' to search special charactersgrep '[[:punct:]]' word-listSearch for a fix digit intervalIn demo 6 it runs grep -P '(?&lt;!\\d)\\d{4}(?!\\d)' using -P to leverage a perl expression. Here’s a good article on StackExchange by Eliah Kagan explaining in detail.grep -P '(?&lt;!\\d)\\d{4}(?!\\d)' word-listConculsionThe grep command is a powerful tool, there are more features not mentioned here.

Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-All2. Test vagrant application functionalityOn a linux instance run sudo /sbin/vboxconfig from the command line an ensure all checks are cleared. Testing Vagrant Application Run vagrant commands to ensure the application is installed correctly. Start/Initialize the Project Navigate to the project folder and initialize a vagrant config file vagrant.exe init hashicorp bionic64 note bionic64 is a maintained custom image of Ubuntu by hashicorp. Start the vagrant VM installation Run vagrant.exe up this will initiate the build process, it will look for the vagrant version of ubuntu if not available it will download from the Vagrant Cloud https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/bionic64 Destroy the vagrant instance Run vagrant.exe destroy this will destroy the vagrant vm instance. Testing VM Automation with Chef Zero1. Create a Chef project folder I recommend creating the subfolder within the same project directory for easy management/reference. It can get confusing as the build progress with new files and folders. Hence take the time to plan out the folder structure for the project. mkdir /home/userA/Desktop/chef_myproj 2. Initialize a Chef cookbook (a.k.a template) Navigate to the project folder and use chef generate cookbook cd /home/userA/Desktop/chef_myprojchef generate cookbook chef_myproj_cookbook Tip chef_myproj_cookbook is the subfolder where all the configuration files for Chef will be saved in.3. Test build using kitchen cli Run kitchen list to test deployable vagrant vm instances. Note: Code deployment for Ubuntu64, requires an internet connection to download the packages &amp; it’s dependencies." }, { "title": "Learning Python", "url": "/posts/python-basics/", "categories": "tutorial, python", "tags": "python", "date": "2022-06-01 06:10:00 +0000", "snippet": "Learn The BasicI had taken serveral python courses before and wrote basic loop and if statements but actually applying coding prinicpals to tackle a problem/solution is a whole different story.Lear...", "content": "Learn The BasicI had taken serveral python courses before and wrote basic loop and if statements but actually applying coding prinicpals to tackle a problem/solution is a whole different story.Learn the basics throughly and be patient with the process.Python Terminal ProgramTips for real-world application When writing code follow the best practices outlined in PEP20 - Zen of Python Check any incoming input strings and prep to remove empty spaces with strip() remember we’re humans and sometimes people type added an extra space at the end by accident. Use join to save time for concatenating (combining) a list of str values. #Example color_list = ['red','blue'] print('$'.join(color_list)) Using the help() function to print all the properties of a given class or method. #Example #Print help for the str method on the python console help(str) To check builtin-in modules loaded use the dunder method and output the properties. Loop through __builtins__.__dict__ and review modules for additional info. #Example for x in __builtins__.__dict__: print(x) or with comprehension #Example [print(x) for x in __builtins__.__dict__] Practice using python comprehension to simplify code. . Use a package manager for python to orchestrate module installation, I perfer poetry. This auto install dependicies for the code to work outside of the system global Having a good understanding of the fundamental topics such as methods, class, and functions will significantly increase your ability to develop/brainstorm solutions for the attended problem. #Example #Using open(), str(), list() methods to modify a given csv file. with open('file.csv',) as csvfile: content = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',') for row in content: for color in row: print(color) Basic Knowledege When creating a variable, it must start as a letter or an underscore Python treats characters differently depending on the class, i.e. ‘1’ is not 1 When in doubt reference Python documentationManipluating the string = strAny string / str can be modified, there are many str.methods at your disposal to transform the characters to your need.String SplicingEssentially selecting a character by picking it’s positional place in the word. Remember positional value starts from 0 and empty value (i.e. blank space) counts.#Exampleword = 'Hello World!'print(word[0])print(word[1])print(word[11])String Splicing IIYou can also iterate over strings with a verbose method [a:b:c] a is the starting position b is the ending position c is the frequencyNote: When using this method positional value start at 1. Default starting value is 0, and frequency value is 1, [0::1] To print in reverse order use the frequency value at -1, [::-1]#Exampleword = 'Hello World!'print(word[1:5:])print(word[::2])print(word[::-1])String AlignmentYou can align string depending on the position of a give text value with the str:&lt;value#Examplemy_string = '{string1:&gt;1}'my_string2 = '{string1:&gt;10}'print(my_string.format(string1='Hello'))print(my_string2.format(string1='Hello'))ExceptionsAre used to handled data that does not mesh with your code. Example, you want a user to enter a data in string format, you can use the Exception class dervived from the BaseException to throw and error." }, { "title": "Building a Cyber Range Lab", "url": "/posts/building-a-cyber-range-lab/", "categories": "tutorial, cyber-range", "tags": "labs", "date": "2022-04-10 06:10:00 +0000", "snippet": "Why Build?For any inspiring professional wanting to break into the tech field, you have to learn and perform your craft quickly.I’ve learned over time the fastest way to upskill for a technical IT ...", "content": "Why Build?For any inspiring professional wanting to break into the tech field, you have to learn and perform your craft quickly.I’ve learned over time the fastest way to upskill for a technical IT craft is going straight to the hands-on portion combined with visual aids like reading and watching videos.
